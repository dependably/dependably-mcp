## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

First public release — the PAT-only v1 surface.

### Added

- 11 tools across 5 groups, authenticated with a Dependably Personal Access Token:
  - **yank** — `yank_version`
  - **siem** — `siem_list_auth_events`, `siem_vulnerabilities_summary`
  - **import** (opt-in via `DEPENDABLY_IMPORT_ROOT`) — `import_manifest`, `admin_upload`
  - **observability** — `health_check`, `readiness_check`, `get_version`, `get_prometheus_metrics`
  - **setup** (local, no server call) — `get_install_command`, `get_publish_command`
- Import-root sandboxing: the two import tools are only registered when
  `DEPENDABLY_IMPORT_ROOT` is set and refuse to read any path (symlinks included)
  that resolves outside it.
- RFC 7807-aware error formatting with actionable 401/403/429/5xx messages.
- In-memory smoke test asserting the tool surface and import-root containment.

### Notes

- The read/browse surface (package inventory, vulnerability list, audit logs, org
  settings, whoami, search) is deferred to v2, pending server-side PAT support on
  read endpoints (dependably-community#343).
